Standard Time

Until 1883, each city or district maintained its own time, usually
accepting what is known as True Time. This condition caused
complications. For example: Many railroad-station clocks either gave
two times, or else there were separate clocks for each time, some of
the trains leaving the station on what was know as New York time, while
others left on local time. Banks and business houses closed on either
of the times. There was no standard and no agreement.

In 1883, Standard Time was established.

The First Section was known as the Eastern, and covered all territory
between the Atlantic Coast and a line drawn from Detroit, Michigan, to
Charleston, South Carolina.

The Central Section included everything between the Detroit-Charleston
line, and a line drawn from Bismarck, North Dakota, to the mouth of the
Rio Grande River.

The Third Section, known as "Mountain Time," included the territory
between the Bismarck-Rio Grande line and the western borders of Idaho,
Utah, and Arizona.

The Pacific Time Section embraced everything west of the Mountain Time
line, up to and including the Pacific coast.

There is a difference of just one hour between the sections. When it is
12 o'clock at Boston, Mass., or at New York City, it is 11 o'clock at
Chicago, and at San Francisco 9 o'clock.

The changing from so-called Local or True Time to Standard Time
required clocks at Boston to be set back 16 minutes; New York clocks to
be set back 4 minutes; Detroit clocks to be set back 28 minutes; St.
Louis clocks to be moved ahead one minute; and San Francisco clocks to
be set ahead ten minutes.

Standard Time has been accepted by every State and by practically
every city, although a very few cities and towns unprogressively hold
to the former or True Time. The Canadian Pacific Railroad, which has
the longest mileage of any railroad in the world, is run on what is
known as the 24-Hour Time; that is, the faces of its clocks, instead
of bearing the figures 1 to 12, run from 1 to 24 inclusive. The
time-tables are rather confusing, as trains are billed to arrive and
depart at 13:10, 16:14, 23:30, etc. This system appears to have only
one advantage,--that it eliminates the use of A. M. and P. M. It is
possible that it will be accepted elsewhere, and even generally, but
not for the present.


=Star Chamber.=--A tribunal, made up of a committee of the King's
Privy Council, instituted or revived in 1486. It was supposed to have
almost unlimited powers and to be exempt from any rules or law. It had
the right to inflict any form of punishment except death. The term is
now applied to assemblies or committees or others who conduct their
investigations and decide upon questions in secret.

=Star-Spangled Banner.=--The national song of the United States.
Composed by Francis Scott Key on the night of September 13, 1814. "The
cartel-ship _Minden_ was anchored in sight of Fort McHenry, and from
her deck Key saw, during the night of 13 Sept., 1814, the bombardment
of that fortress. It was during the excitement of this attack, and
while pacing the deck of the _Minden_ with intense anxiety between
midnight and dawn, that Key composed the song. It was first written on
the back of a letter, and after his return to Baltimore copied out in
full."--Harper's "Book of Facts."

Stature and Weights

There have appeared in public print, several tables, which, the
compilers claim, are based upon Greek and other measurements. It is
probable that few of these tables are authentic, and many of them are,
undoubtedly, incorrect. The following table is compiled by Jay W.
Seaver, M. D., for 20 years professor at Yale University, and is as
nearly correct as possibility would admit. Dr. Seaver, however, does
not claim absolute correctness. The second and third tables given are
used quite generally in civil service examinations by local, state, and
national governments, and apply largely to those seeking positions on
the police force or the fire department

=Steam Engine.=--The principle of the steam engine is very simple.
Stripped of all technicality, it may be described as follows: Take a
can with a height somewhat longer than its width, and close up both
ends. Make a hole in the center of one of the ends large enough for the
insertion of a rod about the diameter of a small poker. Fasten one end
of this rod to the center of a disc which will fit closely into the
can. Insert this disc in the can with the poker passing through the
hole. The whole apparatus will be similar to that of a churn. Bore two
holes in the sides of the can, at top and bottom. Allow steam to pass
into the can through the first hole, which will force the disc to the
other end of the can, and draw the poker with it. Then, introduce steam
through the other hole. This will drive the disc to the other end of
the can, and at the same time the steam entering the first hole will
pass out. This gives a motion to the poker rod, which continues so long
as steam is forced in and out. The rod, is, of course, connected with a
crank which works on a shaft, and from this shaft power is transmitted.
The steam is let into the cylinder automatically. A fly wheel is
maintained where there is not more than one cylinder, and even where
there is more than one, so as to create momentum, which carries the
crank beyond its dead center. The modern steam engine makes from 100 to
even 1,000 revolutions a minute. Its power is measured by its capacity
to equal that of one or several horses, and is known as horse-power.
Steam engines are made with a capacity of only a small fraction of
horse-power, and up to several thousand. But usually, where great power
is required, more than one cylinder is used, all of them working upon
the same shaft The so-called turbine steam engine is similar to the
ordinary turbine water wheel, except that steam, instead of water, is
forced against it. See "Turbines."


=Strikes.=--The strike is an agreement upon the part of workmen to
refuse to work until their demands are accepted. The first strike
in the United States took place in New York City, in 1803, and was
confined to sailors. In 1888, there were 697 strikes, involving over
210,000 employees. In 1886, the number of strikes increased 52 per
cent., and in 1888 the increase was 22 per cent. In the early days
nearly half of the strikes were in Pennsylvania. The great coal
strike of 1902 was probably the most disastrous and largest strike on
record. It involved about 150,000 men, with a loss of wages of nearly
$40,000,000.


=Sub Rosa.=--The term "under the rose" implies secrecy. It had its
origin B. C. 477, when Pausanias, commander of the fleet of Spartans
and Athenians, was intriguing with Xerxes for the subjugation of Greece
to Persia and for the hand of the king's daughter in marriage. The
business was transacted in the "Brazen House," the roof of which was a
garden making a bower of roses. Hence the term Sub Rosa.


=Sugar Industry.=--The United States consumes each year nearly
3,500,000 tons of sugar, or about 80 pounds per capita.


=Sunday Schools.=--The Sunday Schools of the United States have a
membership of about 15,500,000, including teachers. The Sunday School
membership of England and Wales is over 7,000,000. Connected with the
Sunday Schools of the world are about 2,650,000 teachers and 26,500,000
scholars.


=Talking Machines.=--The talking machine, known by several names,
including the phonograph, was originally invented by Edison.
Unscientifically speaking, it consists of a disc similar to that used
in the telephone, with a needle or point attached to the center of the
underside of it. This needle or point fits into circular or cylindrical
grooves, which are covered with tin foil or other malleable substance.

The vibrations of the voice or of music, which reach the disc, cause
this needle or point to rise or fall, producing impressions upon the
tin foil or other substance. After the record has been made, duplicates
are produced in a substance largely made of rubber, which is placed on
a rotary disc or cylinder that is turned automatically, the needle or
point attached to the disc working into the grooves and rising with or
following the impressions, which cause the plate or disc to vibrate.
The process is wholly mechanical, and electricity is not used.


=Tariff.=--This word, meaning a schedule of duties on merchandise,
imported or exported, is said to come from Tarifa, a town in Southern
Spain, on the Mediterranean Sea, where duties were once levied by the
Moors on all ships passing in or out of the Straits of Gibraltar.


=Telegraph.=--The conception of the telegraph came to Professor Morse,
in 1832, while he was making a voyage from Europe to America, and he at
once began his experiments, which resulted in what may be considered
one of the two greatest inventions or discoveries. After waiting about
eight years, Congress reluctantly appropriated a sum sufficient to
build a telegraph line between Washington and Baltimore. The original
conception of telegraphy belongs wholly to Professor Morse, but since
its invention other scientists have invented improvements, including an
apparatus which allows the sending of two messages each way, or four
messages in all, over the same wire at the same time. The telegraphic
code or alphabet, originally invented by Morse, remains practically
intact. It consists of dots and dashes, and may be learned in a few
hours, although expertness requires a year or more of practice.
Unscientifically speaking, the telegraphic apparatus is extremely
simple: it consists primarily of a piece of soft iron around which
is wound several strands of insulated wire. During the time that
electricity is passing through this wire, the soft iron becomes a
magnet, but returns to its nonmagnetic character when electricity
is not passing around it. A battery is used for the generating of
electricity. The operator turns electricity into the wire by pressing a
key. When the key is down, the electricity passes around the piece of
soft iron and makes of it a magnet, which will draw iron or steel to
it, the same as does any ordinary permanent magnet. Just above the end
of the soft iron is placed a piece of metal, and as the key is pressed
letting in the electricity, the iron (then a magnet) draws this metal
to it, producing a slight sound or click. This piece of iron is held
by a spring, and springs back into place when electricity is let out
of the insulated wire surrounding the soft iron. If a message is to
be sent a long distance, a relay is used so as to turn into the wire
additional currents of electricity, because electricity loses some of
its strength if carried over a very long wire, and a relay adds new or
fresh currents from separate batteries. In this way, a message can be
sent continuously for several thousand miles, which would be impossible
without the use of relays. The process of sending several messages at
the same time over the same wire is somewhat complicated. The result
is obtained by using currents of electricity of different intensity,
the currents not interfering with each other. The ocean cables are
described under another heading.


=Telephone.=--The telephone is supposed to have been invented by
Professor A. G. Bell, in 1875, but scientists recognize the probable
invention of it, largely in theory, by the eminent scientists Dolbear,
Gray, Edison, and possibly others. It is exceedingly difficult to
describe, other than scientifically, the working of the telephone; and
it cannot be done perfectly until electricity is fully understood. We
know the result, but are not able to locate all of the causes. The
original telephone consisted of a bar of magnetized steel of about the
circumference of an ordinary poker, a few inches in length, around
which was wound insulated wire. At one end of the magnet, and close
to it, was placed a metallic disc about twice the circumference of a
silver dollar and of the thickness of thin tin. Originally the same
instrument was used both for sending and for receiving. Any sound,
including the human voice, brought in direct contact with the disc,
caused it to vibrate, and for some unknown reason these vibrations were
transmitted through the magnet, and by the wires carried to another
similar instrument. The sounds and voice were carried a short distance
without the use of a battery, and the early telephones had ground
circuits; that is, there was only one wire between the stations, the
other wire being grounded by being attached to gas or other pipes,
the electricity making half the circuit through the earth. Later on
a battery was used, which increased the sending distances, but the
ground wire remained for some time. The present telephone consists
of the original telephone as a receiver, but with a transmitter into
which the sender speaks his words. The mechanism of the transmitter
is complicated and cannot be described except scientifically. Its
use allows one to talk long distances, even to the extent of 2,000
miles. Non-technically speaking, then, the telephone consists of a
magnet, insulated wire, and a disc, the vibration upon the disc being
transmitted over the wire from the sending to the receiving station,
electricity being used for conveying the vibrations or sound.

Eight billion, four hundred thousand and twenty-seven million
conversations were held in this country last year over the wires of
the American Telephone and Telegraph Co., according to its annual
report. The daily average was 26,310,000. The company now has telephone
stations in 70,000 cities, towns, and hamlets, which is 5,000 more than
the number of postoffices in the country, and 10,000 more than the
number of railroad stations. Altogether there were 7,456,074 telephone
stations of the company at the end of 1912.


=Ten Great Religions.=--James Freeman Clarke, in his book "Ten Great
Religions," gives the following as the ten most important faiths of
ancient and modern times:

  (1) Confucianism.
  (2) Brahmanism.
  (3) Buddhism.
  (4) Zoroastrianism.
  (5) Religion of Egypt.
  (6) Religion of Greece and Rome.
  (7) Teutonic and Scandinavian Religion.
  (8) Judaism.
  (9) Christianity.
  (10) Islâm.


=Théâtre Français.=--The most famous theatre in Paris, and, perhaps,
in the world. It is situated in the Place du Palais Royal, and is the
home of the Comédie Française. In 1900 it was destroyed by fire, but
immediately rebuilt. The original building was erected in 1782, but was
later much altered.


=Thunder.=--The sound of thunder is produced by the sudden rush of the
air into the vacuum caused by the rapid passage of lightning through
the air.


=Ticket-of-Leave.=--The English Government in 1854 issued a permit
which allowed a convict his liberty before the expiration of his term.
It was necessary for him to report to the police at stated times,
and, if he committed any crime, his ticket-of-leave was recalled. The
ticket-of-leave is similar to probation granted in the United States.


=Time Difference.=--When it is 12 o'clock noon in New York City, it
is 5:13 in Antwerp; about 5:49 in Berlin; about 5:13 in Brussels;
about 1:02 in Buenos Ayres; about 10:49 in Calcutta; about 6:53 in
Constantinople; about 4:30 in Dublin; about 4:34 in Liverpool; about
4:56 in London; about 5:05 in Paris; about 5:46 in Rome; about 6:57
in St. Petersburg. When it is 12 o'clock noon in New York City, it is
33-1/2 minutes earlier in Havana; about 11 hours and 28 minutes earlier
in Hong Kong; about 9 hours and 24 minutes earlier in Melbourne; about
9 hours and 45-1/2 minutes earlier in Yokohama.


=Tobacco Industry.=--The United States grows about 905,000,000 pounds
of tobacco a year, and over a million acres are used for growing
tobacco. The value of the tobacco grown each year is about $85,000,000.


=To Estimate the Weight of Hay.=--Find the length, breadth, and depth
of the hay, in feet, and multiply these three dimensions together; if
the hay is on the wagon or newly stored, divide the product by 540; but
if it is well settled in the mow or stack, divide by 512. If the hay
is baled, 270 cubic feet will weigh a ton. The number of cubic feet in
a circular stack is found by multiplying the average circumference in
yards by itself and this product by four times the height of the stack
in yards; then point off the two right-hand figures and multiply the
result by 27.


=To Find Length of Day or Night.=--At any time of the year add 12
hours to the time of the sun's setting, and from the sum subtract the
time of rising for the length of the day. Subtract the time of setting
from 12 hours, and to the remainder add the time of rising next morning
for the length of the night. These rules are equally true for apparent
time.


=To Measure Corn in the Crib.=--Find the length, breadth, and depth
of the corn, in feet, and multiply these three dimensions together;
this product multiplied by .63 will give the number of heaped bushels
in the ear. Sometimes one and one-half bushels of ears make a bushel
of shelled corn, and sometimes it requires two bushels, the amount
required depending upon the size of the cob, shape of the ear, etc.


=Tom Thumb.=--Tom Thumb was probably the most famous dwarf in the
world, not because of the absence of others of the same height, or
less, but because he was exploited by the late P. T. Barnum. Tom Thumb,
whose real name was Charles S. Stratton, was born in 1838, and died in
1883. In 1842 he was two feet in height and weighed sixteen pounds.
In 1863 his height increased to thirty-one inches, and later to forty
inches.


=To Produce Different Colors.=--The color printed in _italics_ may be
made by mixing the other two colors. _Purple_, red with light blue.
_Brown_, red with black. _Rose_, lake with white. _Drab_, umber with
white. _Chestnut_, white with brown. _Chocolate_, yellow with brown.
_Flesh Color_, carmine with straw. _Pearl_, blue with lead color.
_Pink_, carmine with white. _Silver Gray_, lamp black with indigo.
_Lead Color_, lamp black with white. _Bright Green_, Paris green with
white. _Buff_, yellow ochre with white. _French White_, white tinted
with purple. _Dark Green_, black with chrome green. _Brilliant Green_,
emerald green with white. _Pea Green_, chrome green with white.
_Orange_, vermillion with chrome yellow. _Straw Color_, chrome yellow
with white lead. _Cream Color_, white tinted with red and yellow.
_Ashes of Roses_, white with tints of black and purple. _French Gray_,
white tinted with black and purple. _Olive_, chrome yellow, blue, and
black with red.


=Trade Unions.=--The trade union, although supposed to be of modern
origin, was established as early as 1548. Mythical history which,
of course, cannot be authenticated, indicates the possibility of an
organization of working men at the time of the building of Solomon's
temple. During the last several years, trade unionism has grown to
enormous proportions, and practically every vocation has its union or
organization. The right to organize is self-evident, so long as it does
not restrain trade or interfere with personal rights. The employee
and employer certainly have legal and moral rights to do as they
please, provided they do not interfere with legal or moral law, and
do not use coercion. Moral influence, however, cannot be criticised.
The maintenance of a well-organized labor union is to the advantage
of both capital and labor, and should be encouraged. Naturally, the
binding together of laborers or workmen, and that of capital, causes
some abuses, for humanity, as it runs, is not always fair; but one
should not criticise either side without criticising the other. Both
have their advantages and disadvantages, both are fair and unfair. As
civilization progresses, the mistakes and abuses will be corrected, and
organized labor and capital will work in harmony.


=Trusts.=--A trust is an association of capitalists, organized for
the purpose of controlling any one trade or trades. It is illegal and
may be punished by imprisonment or fine. It is exceedingly difficult,
however, to discover whether or not an organization is in actual
restraint of trade, and to prosecute a combination. Undoubtedly trusts
exist in America, and all over the world for that matter, and are
illegal. Great effort is being made to disband them, but so far has
very little real effect, for most of the trusts which are disorganized
by law continue in some other form.


=Turbines.=--The turbine has largely taken the place of the water
wheel, because it is more compact, produces greater energy, and is more
powerful. It is, untechnically speaking, a box containing a series of
fanlike blades set at an angle, so that water or steam brought against
them will make them turn.


=Type.=--Movable metallic type was invented by Gutenberg, of Germany,
about 1450. Before this time, all books and papers were either
hand-written or printed from engraved wooden blocks. To-day there are
over 50,000 faces and sizes of type. Type is divided into three great
classes: (1) Roman or body type, which is used for the reading matter
in newspapers, magazines, and books; (2) display type, which appears in
headings, and is used for circulars and the like; and (3) ornamental
type, which has a fancy face. The different sizes of type formerly
bore arbitrary names, like Nonpareil, Pica, etc., but now all type is
under the point system, Nonpareil being known as 6 Point and Pica as
12 Point. The reading matter in all large daily newspapers is set in
6 Point, but most books are printed from either 10, 11, or 12 Point.
Twelve Point type has twice the depth of 6 Point type. Type to be set
is placed in two cases, one known as upper case and the other as lower
case, the former holding capitals and small capitals; the latter small
letters and figures, both cases containing boxes for spaces and other
characters. The compositor holds in his left hand what is known as a
composing stick, or stick. It is made of metal, with a bottom and three
sides, the left side being movable and adjustable. The compositor
places one piece of type at a time in the stick, setting the type from
left to right and upside down. He places metal spaces between each
word. When a line is completed, he sets another, with or without a
piece of thin metal between the lines, known as a lead. When the stick
is full, he dumps his type into a galley, which is a receptacle made of
wood or metal, from one to three feet long, framed at the bottom and at
the sides, but open at the other end. The type is then locked up in a
steel frame or chase, and is ready to be stereotyped, electrotyped, or
to be printed from.


=United States Flag.=--On June 14, 1777, the United States Congress
declared "that the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen
stripes, alternate red and white; that the Union be thirteen stars,
white in a blue field, representing the new constellation." In 1794
Congress decreed that after May 1st, 1795, "The flag of the United
States be fifteen stripes, alternate red and white, and that the Union
be fifteen stars, white in a blue field." At that time the stars and
stripes were of equal number, and it was the intention to add both a
star and stripe with the addition of each new State. Subsequently,
it was found that the addition of a stripe for each new State would
produce a flag altogether too large. Accordingly, Congress, on April
4th, 1818, reduced the number of stripes to thirteen and made the
number of stars twenty, that being the number of States at that time.
It was further enacted that a new star should be added as each new
State was admitted into the Union. By act of Congress, the flag has
become a sacred emblem, and cannot be used for other than decorative or
patriotic purposes, and cannot serve as a part of an advertisement or
other announcement.

=University Extension.=--A scheme for extending to people at large the
advantages of a university education, by means of courses of lectures
and classes in various important cities. The scheme originated at the
University of Cambridge, England, in 1872, and was introduced into the
United States in 1890.


=University Settlements.=--Homes established in the poorer parts of
cities, where educated and cultured people may live and try to improve
the lives of their neighbors. Lectures, studies, and various other
devices are resorted to. The movement started in England in 1867, and
appeared in New York in 1887, as a "Neighborhood Guild." University
settlements are now found in all the chief cities of the United States.


=Utopia.=--An imaginary island, with an ideal commonwealth, the
inhabitants of which enjoy perfect laws and institutions. It is
described in Sir Thomas More's political romance, "De Optimo
Reipublicae Statu, deque Nova Insula Utopia," published in Latin in
1516, and translated into English in 1551. His purpose was to describe
his idea of social arrangements by which the people's most absolute
happiness and improvement might be secured.


=Vaccination.=--Vaccination, a preventive of smallpox, was discovered
by Dr. Edward Jenner of England. It consists of injecting into
the blood a virus made from the sores or scabs of cows suffering
from cowpox, or the virus may be taken from the sore coming from
vaccination itself. Comparatively few people, properly vaccinated, can
have the smallpox, and are largely exempt from any disease resembling
it, except that which is known as varioloid, which is a mild form of
smallpox. It is not known how long vaccination remains a preventive,
but probably for seven years, when one should be vaccinated again. The
prejudice against vaccination, which was very intense at its discovery,
no longer exists except among a few. Practically every physician
advocates it, and it is compulsory in some towns and cities. Deaths
have occurred from it, but they are very infrequent.


=Vacuum.=--The perfect vacuum, which it is impossible to produce, is
space without air or atmosphere. Vacuums are made by pumping all the
air out of a receptacle or chamber. In a vacuum, everything falls
at the same rapidity, as there is nothing to buoy it up, a feather
descending as rapidly as lead shot.


=Vedas.=--Sacred writings of the Hindus, hymns, prayers, and liturgies,
said to have been compiled by Vyasa about 1200 B. C. They are written
in Sanskrit, and divided into four parts.


=Voodooism.=--A degraded form of religion prevalent among the negroes
of Hayti and the Southern States of America. Supposed to be a relic of
the religion of equatorial Africa.


=Watered Stock.=--It is said that the late Commodore Vanderbilt
originated what is known as watered stock. Watered stock is
capitalizing an industry at a figure in advance of its real value.
For example: a railroad has tangible assets of $10,000,000, and an
earning capacity sufficient to pay a 6 per cent. dividend on its
capitalization; financial giants manipulate the stock and increase it
to, say, $20,000,000, watering it to the extent of 100 per cent. In
other words, the real value of the stock then is one-half of what it
was in the first place. Stock watering has become epidemic, and is
the cause of hundreds of thousands of financial failures. The stock
waterers, however, as a rule, win, the public being the victims.


=Wealth of the Nations.=--The estimated wealth of the principal
nations of the earth is given in billions: United States, 130; Great
Britain and Ireland, 80; France, 65; Germany, 60-1/2; Russia, 40;
Austria-Hungary, 25; Italy, 20; Belgium, 9; Spain, 5.4; Netherlands, 5;
Portugal, 2.5; Switzerland, 2.4.


Weather Flags

The Weather Bureau maintained by the United States Department of
Agriculture displays at its stations flags which indicate probable
changes in the weather.

A white flag indicates clear or fair weather.

A blue flag, rain or snow.

A flag with the upper half white and the lower half blue, local rain or
snow.

A black triangular flag indicates temperature.

A white flag with black square in center, a cold wave.

When the black triangular flag is placed above the white flag, the
black flag or the white and blue flag, it indicates warmer weather;
when below, colder.

When the black triangular flag is not displayed at all, the temperature
is likely to remain stationary.

Flags are displayed by the Weather Bureau as storm warnings in the
following manner:

Small Craft Warning: A red pennant indicates that moderately strong
winds are expected.

Storm Warning: A red flag with a black center indicates that a storm of
marked violence is expected.

The pennants displayed with the flags indicate the direction of the
wind--white, westerly (from southwest to north); red, easterly (from
northeast to south). The pennant above the flag indicates that the
wind is expected to blow from the northerly quadrants; below, from the
southerly quadrants.

By night a red light indicates easterly winds, and a white light below
a red light, westerly winds.

Hurricane Warning: Two red flags with black centers, displayed
one above the other, indicate the expected approach of a tropical
hurricane, or one of those extremely severe and dangerous storms which
occasionally move across the Lakes and Northern Atlantic coast.

No night small craft or hurricane warnings are displayed.

BOARD AND TIMBER MEASURE

  BOARD MEASURE

 In board measure boards are assumed to be one inch in thickness.

 To compute the measure of surface in square feet--

 When all dimensions are in feet, multiply the length by the breadth,
 and the product will give the surface required.

 When either of the dimensions are in inches, multiply as above and
 divide by 12.

 When all dimensions are in inches, multiply as before and divide
 product by 144.

  TIMBER MEASURE

 To compute the volume of round timber--

 When all dimensions are in feet, multiply the length by the square
 of one-quarter of the main girt, and the product will give the
 measurement in cubic feet.

 When length is given in feet and girt in inches, multiply as before
 and divide by 144.

 When all the dimensions are in inches, multiply as before and divide
 by 1,728.

 Sawed or hewed timber is measured by the cubic foot.

 To compute the volume of square timber--

 When all dimensions are in feet, multiply the product of the breadth
 by the depth by the length, and the product will give the volume in
 cubic feet.

 When either of the dimensions are in inches, multiply as above and
 divide the product by 12.

 When any two of the dimensions are in inches, multiply as before and
 divide the product by 144.


WHAT TO DO IN EMERGENCIES

Many books and pamphlets have been written advising the layman what
to do in a case of emergency, and in the absence of a physician or
surgeon.

Much of the information presented is altogether too technical, and is
not likely to be understood by the public at large.

The author has attempted to cover, in a few pages, the fundamentals
of first aid to the injured, and has carefully avoided technical and
medicinal terms. No amount of information, no matter how carefully
or plainly written, can take the place of the physician or surgeon.
Self-doctoring and -dosing is, or should be, considered a crime, and
no one is justified in attempting to relieve any one suffering from
accident or any other ailment, if it is of possible seriousness, unless
a good physician or surgeon cannot be procured.

First and always, keep your head, and keep cool. Don't get excited.
Work rapidly, but deliberately. If the injury or trouble is at all
serious, summon a surgeon or physician immediately. If you are alone
with the sufferer, it may not be safe for you to leave him, but unless
he is in immediate danger, it is better to call a competent physician,
even though you have to absent yourself from him for a few moments. If
the accident occurs in a crowd, solicit some one who looks trustworthy,
and request him to telephone or otherwise communicate with a doctor.

If you know the cause of the accident or trouble inform the physician
in advance, so that he may be better prepared to meet it and bring with
him instruments and remedies.

The patient or sufferer should be placed in a comfortable position, a
doctor or surgeon summoned, and in the interval the layman may follow
the instructions presented here. If he does so, no harm will be done,
and in many cases suffering will be relieved, and death or serious
illness prevented. But the author again, and most emphatically, urges
the layman to send for a physician or surgeon, and to follow the
instructions or information given in this chapter only as preliminary
to the arrival of the doctor or surgeon, unless the injury be of slight
consequence.

If possible, remove the patient to a quiet place, where there is plenty
of air, and where the temperature is normal.

If there are many people about, request them to keep away.

Place the injured person in a comfortable position, usually upon his
back, and straighten out his legs and arms. If the head is injured,
better lift it above the level of the body; but if it is not, allow the
body to lie on a level.

If the patient is breathing hard, it may be well to lift him into a
sitting position. Loosen his collar, waist-band, and clothing. If he
faints, his head should be slightly lower than his feet. If an arm or
leg is injured, lift it slightly and place it upon a cushion, pillow,
or other support.

If the one injured is unconscious, watch him very carefully. If he is
vomiting, or that tendency is apparent, turn him over on one side so
that the discharge will run out easily and not go into the lungs.

If he is wounded, cut away the clothing covering the wound, but don't
remove any more than is necessary. If he has been burned, pour lukewarm
water, containing a little saleratus or bicarbonate of soda, over
the clothing before you remove it. If he is bleeding severely, stop
the bleeding before dressing the wound. After the wound is dressed
there is nothing for the novice to do, except bring the patient to
consciousness, if unconscious, and remove him to a place of safety and
comfort.

If the accident or injury be serious, or the patient is unconscious,
it is well to request more than one bystander to summon a physician,
because the first one sent may fail, or the physician he telephones to
or calls upon may be unavailable.

Use the telephone, if there is one at hand or nearby, and tell the
physician what you think is the matter with the sufferer or what caused
the accident, that he may be better prepared to bring with him the
instruments necessary.

If you are alone with the patient, and cannot notify a physician or
surgeon without leaving the patient, you must use your best judgment;
but you should make every possible effort to reach a physician at the
earliest possible moment. Remain with the patient long enough to
place him in a comfortable position, and to stop the flow of blood, if
bleeding; then make all haste to notify a physician or surgeon.

published by Johnson & Johnson of New Brunswick, N. J., and to Jay W.
Seaver, M. D., of New Haven, Conn., and recently of Yale University.


=Accidents.=--Convey the sufferer to a place of safety, and give him
plenty of air. If a shock follows, follow instructions given for shock.
Do not touch the wound with the bare hand. Wear absolutely clean gloves
or wrap the fingers in clean cloth or gauze. Do not attempt to cleanse
the wound. Summon a surgeon immediately.


=Apparent Death.=--Never assume that a person is dead because he
appears to be. Summon a physician. A fairly good test of death is to
hold the hand of the person apparently dead before a candle or other
light, with the fingers stretched out, each touching the other. Gaze
intently between the fingers, and if the person is alive, a red or pink
color will undoubtedly be seen where the fingers touch each other.
Another method is to take a cold piece of polished steel, like a razor
blade or table knife, and hold before the mouth or nose of the person
apparently dead. If moisture does not gather on it, it may be safe to
assume that breathing has stopped; but these tests are not infallible.


=Bandaging.=--There are two kinds of bandages,--the roller bandage
or the triangular or handkerchief bandage. They may be purchased at
any drug store or be made on the spot in an emergency. The purchased
bandages are made of gauze, or muslin, crinolin, elastic webbing,
rubber, or other material. The roller bandages are absorbent, and are
very thin and pliable. They should be placed next to the wound and hold
the fluids. Muslin bandages are stronger than those made of gauze, and
should be used for pressure and outside bandages. Bandages should be
kept in a perfectly clean place, and always covered, either by being
enclosed in a box or wrapped in paper. If an improvised bandage is
used, care should be taken to use a clean cloth. The triangular bandage
is made by cutting a piece of cloth about 36 inches square into two
pieces diagonally. It can be purchased at a drug store, or any clean
cloth can be used if it is of firm texture.


=Baths.=--Cold baths may be taken to reduce fever and in sunstroke
and other cases when the temperature is high. It is well to have the
temperature in the bath at 70° or 80° Fahrenheit, and to reduce the
water until it reaches 60° or 65°. Tepid baths have a temperature of
80° or 90°, and warm baths are of a temperature from 90° to a little
less than 100°. Hot baths may be used in case of shock, apparent
drowning, depression, and similar troubles. The temperature of the
water should vary from 98° to 110°. When the patient leaves the bath,
he should be dried quickly and put to bed. Hot baths may produce
fainting, and should be taken in the presence of an attendant. Do not
guess at the temperature of the water; use a thermometer.


=Bleeding.=--Arterial blood, or blood coming from the arteries, is
bright red, and is discharged in spurts or jets. Such bleeding is
very dangerous, and unless a physician arrives almost immediately the
patient is not likely to survive.

Venous blood, which comes from the veins, is of dark purple color and
flows freely and steadily.

Capillary bleeding comes from injured small veins. It flows slowly,
and such bleeding is dangerous only if it continues. Always summon
a surgeon or physician, and put in a hurry call for him. Force the
patient to lie down in a level position, preferably upon his back.

If the leg or arm is wounded, elevate it. Cut away the clothing
quickly, so that it may be exposed. Press the bleeding places, but
cover your finger with gauze or a clean handkerchief, or compress the
part by using a strong cloth bandage.

If the bleeding comes from an artery, cover your finger with a few
thicknesses of gauze or clean cloth, and press hard upon the wound and
maintain the pressure, which may stop the bleeding. If the wound is
large, crowd a lot of gauze into it, and push it in, then press on the
flesh a little distance above the wound, that is, between the wound and
the heart. This can be done by winding a bandage, a piece of rubber
tubing, string, or rope, or a pair of suspenders may be used, above the
wound.

If the arm or leg is crushed, do not press on the wound, but bring
pressure to bear above it.


=Bleeding from the Veins.=--Lay a piece of gauze over the wound and
bind it on with a firm bandage. Be very careful not to apply your
naked fingers or hand to the wound unless you have washed them in some
antiseptic, but even then it is better to cover your fingers with clean
gauze or cloth. If the bleeding is very severe, apply cracked ice
wrapped in gauze, and hard pressure below the wound. Varicose veins
occasionally bleed. Elevate the arm or leg and bandage it very tightly,
the bandage to be placed directly over the bleeding spot.


=Bleeding from Capillary Veins.=--As the blood oozes, and does not
flow rapidly, expose the wound to the air for a short time, which will
usually check it. The application of hot water is advisable, but warm
water should not be used. Extremely cold water or cracked ice will stop
some bleeding. If copious bleeding occurs around a tooth, it may be
stopped by packing the place with plaster of Paris, or absorbent cotton
may be used. In every case, keep the places warm. After the bleeding is
stopped, give hot drinks, like hot tea, coffee, or milk, if much blood
has been lost.


=Broken Bones.=--Do not attempt to set the break. Handle the patient
carefully. Place him in a comfortable position and undress him,
removing the clothing by cutting it to save time. If it is necessary
to carry him a distance, improvise a splint made of wood or heavy
pasteboard and fasten it around the broken part with bandages. Carry
him to a physician or summon one at once, but let him lie quietly if a
physician can reach him. It is well to have two splints, one on each
side, to be held in place by the same bandages. If the arm is broken,
bandage it and place it in a sling. In every case, summon a physician
or carry the patient to one.


=Chilblains.=--Keep the feet warm and dry. Don't warm them at a fire or
place them in hot water, but bathe them in cold water and rub with a
dry towel. Apply turpentine, camphorated spirits, or oil of wintergreen.


Cleanliness

It is said that cleanliness is next to godliness. Good health is
dependent upon the care of the body, and the body will not remain in a
healthful state unless frequently bathed.

The fact that thousands of persons enjoy good health without even
taking an infrequent bath, must not be used as an argument against
regular bathing. These persons, if in health, live out of doors, and
Nature seems to take care of them; but it is obvious that they would
be healthier and stronger if they gave proper attention to bodily
cleanliness.

The majority of city dwellers, and a large proportion of those living
in the country, work indoors, and their health is dependent upon their
personal cleanliness.

Opinions differ, and some hygienists do not consider the daily bath
essential, but the majority of those who have studied the subject
maintain that perfect health requires the daily bathing of the entire
body.

Without the daily bath one does not begin his work refreshed or with
exhilaration.

A scrub is not to be recommended more than once a week, but a bath
should be taken daily, and the entire body rubbed with a dry towel,
a bath towel to be preferred. Emersion in a tub of water is not
necessary, although it is the best and easiest way of taking a bath,
next to a shower bath. A sponge bath answers all purposes.

A cold plunge should not be taken without the advice of a physician.
The shower bath is very refreshing. A hot bath is seldom advisable. It
is better to have the water of a temperature not much higher than that
of summer heat. A pure soap should be used, and care should be taken
to rinse it from the body. The daily bath is the best preventive of
colds. Comparatively few people who bathe daily suffer from more than
transient colds.

The bath should not be taken in a draught. If the room is cold, work
rapidly and use additional time for rubbing, continuing it until the
skin glows.

The practice of partial bathing is not to be recommended. When you take
a bath, take it all over.

If away from home, and sleeping in a hotel bed, which may have been
occupied by a diseased person, it is well to go over the body carefully
in the morning with an antiseptic soap. Every hotel, and all public
conveyances, are laden with germs, and a bath will prevent many
diseases.

A few drops of ammonia or a teaspoonful of borax placed in the water
in which you bathe will remove the odor of perspiration, but ammonia
should not take the place of good soap.


=Clothing Afire.=--Force the person afire to lie down and roll him over
and over. Wrap him in a rug or blanket, or anything else at hand. Throw
water upon him, but do not wait for water. Wrapping him in a blanket
is sure to extinguish the flames. Under no circumstances allow the
person afire to run about or out of doors.


=Colds.=--Use simple remedies, such as hot lemonade, but if the cold
does not soon abate, consult a physician.


=Diphtheria.=--Consult your physician. Never go near a case of
diphtheria or allow a dog, cat, or other animal to enter the sick-room.
Be careful of every utensil, and do not allow any one else to use them
until they have been washed in antiseptics. Never handle any clothing
or other articles in a sick-room.


Disinfectants

The reader is warned against placing reliance upon any disinfectant,
because it smells of carbolic acid, or has any other strong odor. Many
of the advertised disinfectants are worthless, and some of them are
merely deodorizers, which destroy smell and don't disinfect.

Sulphur or brimstone is probably the best fumigator. Sulphite of iron
(copperas) is cheap and should be used for sewers and drains. Dissolve
a pound and a half in a gallon of water. Two parts of sulphate of zinc
to one part of common salt, dissolved in a gallon of water, is a good
disinfectant for clothing, bed linen, etc.

Carbolic acid is an excellent disinfectant, but is efficacious only
when used at considerable strength, 3 to 5 per cent. Its strong odor
suggests qualities which do not exist, if it is much diluted.

There are many disinfectants upon the market, many of them being
advertised to be efficacious. Some of them are thoroughly reliable, but
others are almost worthless. I would advise the reader not to purchase
or use a disinfectant which is not recommended by a reliable physician.


=Disinfecting Cellars, Yards, Cesspools, etc.=--Use a solution made of
60 pounds of copperas dissolved in a barrel of water. Sprinkle freely
over cellar and put a pailful in a cesspool.


=Disinfecting the Sick-Room.=--Plenty of fresh air and cleanliness are
to be first considered. The clothing, bed linen, and towels should be
washed in a tub containing a zinc chloride solution, and the water
should be boiling hot. A solution of copperas and water should be
immediately placed in all vessels containing discharges.


=Dislocations.=--The novice should never attempt to treat a
dislocation. All he can do is to place the patient in a comfortable
position, using a sling or cushion to support the part injured. A
physician should be summoned.


=Dog Bites.=--Wash the wound with antiseptic soap or pure soap and
water, with borax dissolved in it to the strength of a teaspoonful to
a pint. Hydrophobia occurs very infrequently, and many dogs, supposed
to be mad, are suffering from some other ailment; but a surgeon should
be summoned in all cases whenever it is possible to do so. The bite
of a rat, cat, or other animal is not generally dangerous, but the
wound should be washed with borax and water, as above. Better summon a
surgeon. Suck the wound vigorously before applying washes. There is no
danger to the person sucking a wound of this nature, unless the skin on
his lips or in his mouth is cracked or bleeding, but he may wash his
mouth with borax water if he feels uneasy about it.


Drowning

If the person is conscious tell him that you will save him, which will
prevent him from losing his nerve. If you swim out for him, and he is
struggling, seize him by the hair and turn him over on his back. Swim
on your side, towing him along as you would a log of wood. You may
hold his head with one arm, but do not attempt to support his entire
body. If he struggles violently, hold his head under water until he is
unconscious, so that you can better handle him. Loosen his clothing,
drain water out of lungs by inverting body, clean out his mouth, and
pull his tongue forward. Immediately begin artificial respiration, each
movement to last from four to five seconds. Apply warmth and rubbing,
and when he is conscious give him hot water, coffee, or lemonade.
Artificial breathing is of greatest consequence. Do not give up. Many
persons have been resuscitated after many hours of incessant labor.
Artificial respiration may be performed in the following way:

First--Immediately loosen the clothing about the neck and chest,
exposing them to the wind, except in very severe weather. Get the water
out of the body, first by tickling throat with a feather, or applying
ammonia to the nose; give a severe slap with the open hand upon the
chest and soles of feet; if no immediate result, proceed as follows:

Second--Lay the body down in the open air with the head hanging down
and with its weight on the stomach across any convenient object, such
as a keg, box, boat timber, or your knees. Open the mouth quickly,
drawing the tongue forward with handkerchief or cloth to let the water
escape. Keep the mouth clear of liquid. To relieve the pressure on the
stomach, roll the body gently from side to side and then back on the
stomach. Do this several times to force the water from the stomach and
throat.

Third--Lay the body on the back, make a roll of a coat or any garment,
place it under the shoulders of the patient, allowing the head to fall
back. Then kneel at the head of the patient.

Open patient's mouth and place some small object between teeth.

With tongue pliers or fingers covered with gauze or cloth, grasp his
tongue and draw it out. Tie it down to his chin with cloth or rubber
band.

Grasp the patient's arms at the middle of the forearms, fold them
across his stomach, and raise them over his head to a perpendicular
position, drawing them backward, straight, then forward overhead to
the sides again, pressing the arms on the lower part of the ribs and
side, so as to produce a bellows movement upon the lungs. Do this about
fifteen times a minute.

Apply smelling salts, camphor, or ammonia to the nostrils to excite
breathing.

Fourth--On signs of life, or when breathing is restored, remove the
clothing, dry the body, wrap the patient in warm blankets or hot
cloths. To encourage circulation briskly rub his limbs under the
blankets toward the heart; brandy or aromatic spirits of ammonia may be
given in small doses, with care to avoid strangulation.


Another Method

Another simple method of restoring breathing, one that is being
rapidly adopted, is that known as the Schafer, or prone, method. It has
the great advantage that it can be performed by one man alone. This
method has just been endorsed as the preferable one by a commission
representing the American Medical Association, the National Electric
Light Association, and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.

First--Lay patient on stomach with his head to side and withdraw his
tongue, which itself then will hang out if teeth are held apart with
small object. The operator then kneels astride the patient's thighs and
with his hands across the lower ribs swings his body back and forth
rhythmically, pausing about two seconds as his weight falls upon and is
removed from patient. This movement is to be continued at the rate of
about fifteen times a minute.


=To Prevent Drowning.=--The human body weighs, in the water, about one
pound; that is, it is approximately one pound heavier than the water
which it displaces. A stool, chair, or small box or board will overcome
the tendency to sink and will keep the head above water. The feet, and
the hand which is not clinging to an object, should be used as paddles.
Every one should learn to swim. If he can take only a few strokes, the
chances of death by drowning are small, for he is likely to be able to
reach something which will support him. So much do I believe in the
necessity of knowing how to swim, that I consider it a crime not to
understand this art.


=Electrical Accidents.=--Immediately shut off the current, but do not
handle the wire with your naked hands. If rubber gloves are not handy,
cut the wire with an ax or knife, with a piece of woolen cloth wrapped
around the handle. If you pull the sufferer away from the wire, do
not touch him with your bare hands, but cover them with woolen cloth,
or wear rubber or woolen gloves, or remove him by the use of a rope.
The ordinary electric shock will not cause death unless the patient
continues to receive it. Summon a doctor at once. Place the patient in
the open air, with something under his shoulders. Loosen his clothing,
open his mouth, and pull out the tongue. Clear the mouth from saliva.
Force air into his lungs by pressing the base of the ribs about once in
four seconds, then attempt to resuscitate him as you would a drowning
person.


=Emergencies with Children.=--If the child suddenly suffers from
vomiting, purging, and prostration, send for a doctor at once. In the
meantime place him in a hot bath and then carefully dry him with a
warm towel and wrap in warm blankets. If the hands and feet are cold,
apply hot water bottles to the feet and hands. A poultice made of
flaxseed meal (3/4) and mustard (1/4) should be placed over the body.
Five drops of brandy in a teaspoonful of water may be given every 15
minutes. For sudden diarrhoea, administer one teaspoonful of castor oil
or of spiced syrup of rhubarb. Allow the child to drink freely of cold
water that has been boiled. Always summon a physician.


Emergency Medicines ..

The writer would emphatically discourage self-medication and dosing,
and would oppose the taking of medicines of any kind, except the
simplest remedies, without the advice of a physician. Hundreds of
thousands of people have been made sick, because the wrong medicine
was administered to them, and many more have taken medicine when they
didn't need it.

The following emergency medicines are presented, with a distinct
understanding that they should not be used except in simple cases:


=Ammonia.=--What is known as ammonia water, or liquor of ammonia,
or as spirits of hartshorn, or hartshorn, is of several strengths
and is highly irritating and poisonous if taken internally. Applied
externally, if of considerable strength, it will cause blisters and
pain. Ammonia should not be applied to an open wound or irritated
surface, except in case of snake bites or stings of insects, where it
is intended to neutralize the poisons. The vapor of ammonia water,
inhaled through the nostrils, affects the nervous system and may be
used in fainting or epilepsy, but always with caution, for a strong
preparation of ammonia applied to the nose may produce a violent shock.
It is better to saturate a handkerchief or wad of cotton and hold it a
short distance from the nostrils. The buyer is cautioned against the
use of the strongest ammonia water.


=Aromatic Spirits of Ammonia.=--This is a stimulant, and may be used in
cases of sick headache, hysteria, cholic, or fainting, in doses of from
10 to 30 drops in sweetened water.


=Arnica.=--Tincture of arnica is supposed to be of value in accidents,
and especially efficacious for sprains and bruises. It has some value,
mainly from the alcohol it contains and partly because it is applied
with friction. It is a poison, and never should be taken internally.
For external use it should not be applied at full strength, as it is
apt to cause inflammation if the skin is tender.


=Bicarbonate of Soda.=--Bicarbonate of soda, commonly known as baking
soda or saleratus, is distinct from sal soda or washing soda. It is of
great value in the treatment of burns, and may be used as an antidote
in poisoning by acids.


=Camphor.=--Camphor is purchased in gum or in liquid form. It never
should be taken internally, except by advice of a physician. Nor
should it be applied in its full strength directly to the wounds or to
irritated or inflamed surfaces.


=Ginger.=--The essence or extract of ginger is a very popular remedy
for trouble with the digestive organs, bowel complaints, etc., and
should be taken in doses of from 10 to 40 drops in sweetened water,
milk, or other liquid. It never should be used habitually, because
it may establish a drug habit; nor should large doses be taken to
check diarrhoea, as it is often inadvisable to too rapidly check the
discharges.


=Glycerin.=--Glycerin may be used for burns, and, mixed with equal
parts of rose water, it is a good lotion for chapped hands or lips, but
it is irritating to the skin of some people.


=Peppermint.=--The essence of peppermint may be used for stomach-ache
and bowel complaints, the usual dose being from 10 to 20 drops on sugar
or in sweetened water. Oil of peppermint should not be taken, except
when prescribed by a physician.


=Turpentine.=--Turpentine is the base of most liniments, and it has
some value, but mustard plasters are safer. Turpentine is inflammable,
and never should be applied near an open fire. Turpentine should not be
given internally, unless prescribed by a physician.


=Whisky.=--Whisky, brandy, wine, and all other spirits should be used
sparingly. They are likely to do more harm than good. Hot water, hot
coffee, hot tea, or aromatic spirits of ammonia are to be preferred.
Children should never be given spirituous liquids, except in extreme
cases, and then only 10 to 20 drops in water.


=Witch Hazel or Hamamelis.=--Used as a remedy for sprains, wounds, and
swelling. It is a mild application for chapped hands, and used by the
laity for burns, scalds, cuts, etc. It is not irritating, and is a good
substitute for arnica. Its use externally is absolutely safe.


=Vaseline.=--It is to be recommended for burns, scalds, etc. It is
nonirritating and is not poisonous. It can be used frequently.


=Cold Cream.=--A perfectly safe article to be used for chapped hands
and lips, and skin roughness.


=Emetics and Stimulants.=--In practically all cases, and where poison
has entered the stomach, it is well to empty the stomach immediately.
If a stomach pump cannot be procured, an emetic should be administered.
Doctors would administer ipecac, apomorphine, sulphate of zinc, tartar
emetic, and other drugs, but none of them are likely to be available
before the physician arrives. When notifying the physician tell him,
if possible, the kind of poison taken, so he may be prepared. A
dessert-spoonful of ground dry mustard in a glass of warm water is
likely to produce vomiting. Follow the first dose with a second one.
Then push the forefinger down the throat as far as possible, that the
patient may vomit. Dissolve a teaspoonful of salt in water and give to
the patient, or administer a teaspoonful of ipecac every few minutes to
a child, and a tablespoonful to an adult. Follow the dose with a glass
of water and then insert the forefinger in the throat. One who has
taken opium does not vomit easily and strenuous efforts should be made
to produce vomiting. If one emetic does not work, give another, and
keep on repeating it.


Exercise

Physical exercises are absolutely essential to health. The working man,
however, is likely to obtain enough of it from his daily action, but
those of sedentary habits, especially those who work indoors, will not
receive sufficient exercise from their labor.

While the gymnasium is to be recommended, and while it has done much to
make weak people strong, I would not advise any one to take more than
very simple gymnasium exercises without the advice of a physician.
Exercises may be taken in the bedroom, with the use of light dumb
bells, or without the use of any apparatus at all.

Walking is the best of all, for it can be enjoyed by those in poor
health or physically weak. It takes one out of doors, and exercise
out of doors is far better than that taken in a closed room. If you
exercise at home, open all of the windows.

Every one should walk at least two miles a day in the open air, unless
he is very weak. Select a companion, as exercise is more efficacious
if enjoyed and is not mere exercise by itself. Take long breaths in
the open air every morning. Overexercise, and much of that practiced
by athletes, injure the heart and work opposite from the intention. No
strenuous exercise should be taken after mid-life without the advice of
a physician. Any good doctor will prescribe a course of exercises for
you at a nominal fee, most of them not charging more than a dollar for
advice. Then, those who exercise need more food and a different kind of
food from that required by those who do not exercise.

As cases differ, it is inadvisable for me to prescribe proper food.
Consult your physician.


=Extinguishing Fires from Coal Oil.=--Do not attempt to smother the
flame by water. Smother it with a carpet or cloth.


Fainting

Ordinary fainting is distinct from that which occurs from shock or
collapse, the latter following serious injuries, while fainting is
common with some people, and may not be serious.

Those who are subject to frequent fainting spells should consult a
physician that he may locate the cause.

If fainting is caused from any disease of the heart, or from a weak
heart, death may follow, and such persons should be under the care of a
physician.

When fainting occurs, place the patient on his back with his head as
low or lower than the body. Raise the legs. He should have plenty of
fresh air. If fainting occurs in a crowd, ask the spectators to move
away. If in-doors, open all doors and windows, loosen the clothing,
and sprinkle water upon the face, at the same time applying smelling
salts or spirits of camphor held close to the nose, but not touching
it. The body may be rubbed to assist the circulation. If the person
does not quickly revive, apply gentle heat or a mustard plaster to the
pit of the stomach. When he recovers give him hot tea or coffee, and
never more than a moderate amount of alcoholic stimulants. Keep him in
a reclining position for some time after he has recovered.


=Feeding an Invalid.=--If the illness is at all serious, consult a
physician. He will tell you what and what not to give the patient in
the way of food. Never cook the food in the presence of the invalid,
and keep the smell of cooking away from him. Don't eat in his presence,
as it may annoy him. Serve everything attractively, with spotless
napkin, table cloth, and ware. Be careful not to spill anything.
Hot articles should be served very hot, and cold ones very cold,
as lukewarm viands are not acceptable. Everything brought into the
sick-room should be covered with dishes or napkins. Better bring in too
little than too much, more to be served if the patient desires it.


=Fire in the House.=--When the house is afire cover the head, if
possible, with a wet cloth, or dry one if there is no facility for
wetting it, cutting holes for the eyes. Creep on the floor and don't
stand up or walk, for the air is clearer next to the floor, as smoke
rises. Unless there are plenty of exits, a knotted rope should be
attached to a staple. It is easier to climb down a knotted rope than
one which is smooth. If necessary to jump from an upper story, throw
out a mattress or something else which is soft, and attempt to land
upon it. When at a hotel or boarding house, ascertain the means of exit
before retiring.


=Fits.=--Generally speaking, the treatment should be similar to that
given to one who has fainted. If the patient is hysterical, apply
mustard plasters or ice to the soles of his feet and the wrists, but do
not dash water in the face or use strong emetics or heroic measures. If
the fit is caused by epilepsy (in this case the person is rigid), do
not attempt to stop the patient from struggling. Lay him on his back
with his head somewhat raised, and loosen his clothing. If necessary,
hold his arms and legs gently, but do not use force. Place a stick or
knife handle between the teeth to prevent biting the tongue. Always
summon a physician.


=Frost Bite.=--Never place the patient near a fire. Undress him
carefully and pack frozen parts with cloths wet with ice water. Rub
adjacent parts vigorously. Administer hot coffee or tea. If breathing
appears to have stopped, treat him as you would one apparently drowned.
When the patient begins to revive, place him in a warm, but not a hot,
room, cover him with blankets, and rub him with a cloth wrung out of
hot water; give him the ordinary stimulants, but not alcoholic ones.


=Fumigating a Sick-Room.=--Formalin is probably the best fumigator.
Place the articles to be fumigated in a closed room, and pour
formaldehyde over towels or bed linen and place on the floor. The room
should remain closed for 24 hours. A room containing 100 square feet
of floor surface requires at least a pint of formaldehyde.


Getting Things into the Eye, Nose, Ear, etc.


=Eye.=--Sometimes complications result of a most serious nature.
A physician should be sent for immediately. In the interval the
following directions may be followed: Articles like cinders, dust, and
other small objects may be removed from the eye, if one has a steady
hand; but the eye should not be rubbed, and should be kept closed,
except when one is trying to remove the foreign substance. The tears
by themselves will often wash out ordinary dust or cinders. If the
substance is hidden from view, one or two grains of whole flaxseed
may remove it. Catch the upper lid by the lashes and pull away from
the eyeball over the lower lid, holding it there for a moment, and
request the patient to blow his nose vigorously. Visible articles may
be removed with a piece of gauze on the hand, or an absolutely clean
cloth; but don't touch the eye with the finger. As the eye is a very
delicate organ, the novice should not attempt to operate upon it.


=Nose.=--Blow the nose very hard, and close one side of the nostril
by pressing your finger against it. Tickle the nose or give snuff to
excite sneezing. Sometimes the article will be removed if the patient
takes a long breath and closes his mouth, then give him a sharp blow
on the back. If the body is not discharged, call a physician.


=Ear.=--There is great danger in tampering with the ear. Never insert
needles or pins in an attempt to remove foreign substances. Better send
for a physician. If live insects enter the ear, pour a small quantity
of sweet oil or glycerin into the ear and very gently syringe it with
warm water.


=Throat.=--Send for a physician immediately, and tell him what you
think the matter is, so he may bring the necessary instruments. If
there is no difficulty in breathing, wait for the physician. Slap the
person on the back when the body is bent forward with face downwards,
which will cause him to cough. Elevate him so that his head is lower
than his body and slap him on the back while in this position.


=Getting Wet.=--Many colds are contracted on account of exposure to
rain and moisture. Unless able to change your clothes, keep moving. It
is said that very few colds are contracted while one is exercising.


=Headaches.=--Under no circumstances take a headache powder, or any
drug whatsoever, without the advice of your physician. Many headache
powders contain dangerous drugs, which work upon the heart, sometimes
causing death. Headaches almost invariably come from a cause not
located in the head itself. Do not attempt to cure it yourself. The
headache powder may relieve the headache temporarily at the expense of
the system.


=Hiccoughs.=--Drink a glass full of cold water as rapidly as possible.
Breathe deeply. If the hiccoughs continue, call a physician.


How to Avoid Accidents

Never cross the street without looking both ways.

Do not get off of a car or other vehicle while it is in motion.

Never thrust your head or arms out of the car or other vehicle.

When it is lightning, avoid trees and metallic articles.

Never allow firearms to be lying about. Have some one place for them
and be sure that no one can get at them.

Move quickly when it is cold; and when any part is frozen, do not go
near the fire, but rub with snow.

Always change wet clothing as soon as possible, and keep moving until
you have opportunity to change.

Never walk on a railroad track.

Do not light a fire with kerosene or other inflammable fluid.

Never enter a cellar or anywhere else where gas is escaping with a
light in your hand.

Under no circumstances touch a wire hanging in the street.

Maintain a medicine chest containing all of the common remedies, but
don't select them without the advice of your physician. Mark each
bottle plainly, with directions under the label.

Never take medicine without looking at the label beforehand.


=Illuminating Gas.=--Summon a physician, and before he arrives proceed
as follows: Remove the patient into fresh air and walk him around.
Place his arms about your shoulders, and if there are two rescuers
place one arm around the shoulders of each. A glass of Weiss beer
should be given while the patient is walking, as it removes gas from
the stomach. In five minutes give half a teaspoonful of aromatic
spirits of ammonia in a third of a glass of water. Repeat this dose
every 15 minutes until four doses have been given. The neck of the beer
bottle may be forced into the patient's mouth.


=Infectious Diseases.=--It is now generally supposed that all
contagious and communicable diseases are contracted by the germs which
pass into the body or system. These germs are so small that millions
of them may enter the body through the nose, throat, and skin. They do
little or no harm to a healthy person, for the healthy body is opposed
to their growth, but if one is weak, or suffering from a slight cold,
or is depressed, they may multiply and cause diseases. These germs may
be widely scattered,--in the clothes, bedding, carpets, and in the
hair and skin. They cling to walls and ceilings and they will multiply
on almost any kind of food. No one can wholly prevent coming into
contact with them, but he can, if he will, avoid most of the contagious
diseases by never sitting down in the sick-room, especially avoiding
the bed, and keeping away from the walls and furniture. He should wash
his hands with antiseptic soap after handling the patient. Exercise
regularly in the open air. Nurses should wear washable dresses, which
are frequently changed and a washable cap should cover their hair. When
in the sick-room do not approach the patient near enough to catch his
breath. Do not touch with your lips any food, dish, or utensil which
has been in the sick-room. Do not eat or drink in the sick-room. Wear
no clothing that the patient wore before being taken sick. Never touch
the sick person if your hands are sore or scratched, and be sure to
wash them after contact with him. Never allow the dishes used by the
patient to be used by any other unless they are very carefully washed
and scalded in boiling water. All articles of food not eaten by the
patient should be burned, and milk and food should never be allowed to
stand in the sick-room. All bodily discharges should be immediately
removed and covered with disinfecting solution, and the vessels should
be washed with antiseptics before being brought back into the room.


=Lockjaw.=--Do not attempt to cure it. Consult your physician. It will
probably be fatal.


=Mustard Plasters.=--Plasters occasionally are efficacious, but
most give more apparent than real relief. They should not be used
indiscriminately or without the advice of a physician.


=Neuralgia.=--This is often incurable, but may be relieved.
Certain liniments are efficacious, but are not to be recommended
indiscriminately. Better consult your physician.


Poison

Poisons taken into the system through the mouth, and not through the
blood, require a different treatment.

Poisons may be classified as follows: 1. Irritant, in which the
symptoms appear entirely at the location of the poison. 2. Systemic, in
which the poison affects the system at large in addition to producing
local irritation. 3. Narcotic or sleep-producing. 4. General, in which
there is no local irritation.

In the first mentioned, it is best not to cause vomiting. Give dilute
acids to neutralize alkalis, and dilute alkalis to neutralize acids.
Then administer oil, raw egg, or flour and water. Small doses of
opiates may be given to quiet the pain, and whisky or other spirituous
liquor to relieve weakness.

In the second class (except for arsenic or similar poisoning) no emetic
should be given. The poison may be counteracted by bland doses of oil,
flour, and water, white of eggs; and stimulating drinks should be given
to counteract depression.

In the third class, make strenuous effort to produce vomiting, then
give strong coffee or other stimulating drinks, and make every effort
to keep the patient awake, even if you have to keep him walking.

Fourth class. Give emetics, and follow with stimulating drinks to
relieve weakness and pain. The patient should be allowed to rest.


Poisoning.


=Poisoning by Acids.=--For sulphuric, muriatic, nitric, and acetic
acids give immediately a solution of baking soda or magnesia, chalk,
lime, soap-suds, or chalk tooth powder, followed by raw eggs, milk, or
sweet oil.


=For Carbolic Acid or Creosote.=--Give alcohol and, immediately, castor
oil, sweet oil, raw eggs, or milk, followed by an emetic.


=For Oxalic Acid.=--Administer lime, chalk, or magnesia. Lime may be
scraped from the wall or ceiling and dissolved in water, but don't use
soda, potash, or ammonia.


=For Prussic Acid.=--Generally the patient dies immediately, but
if he is still living, do not stop to give emetics, but administer
stimulants. Apply hot and cold douches and use artificial respiration.


=For Aconite Poisoning.=--Wash the stomach with a stomach tube and
avoid emetics. Use stimulants. Apply warmth to the extremities and
place mustard plasters over the heart and legs. If the patient is
insensible, use artificial respiration.


=For Camphor.=--Give emetics, oils, and eggs. Apply warmth to the
extremities.


=For Chloroform.=--If caused by inhalation, resort to artificial
respiration and apply friction. Place the patient in the fresh air,
keeping the head very low. Alternate hot and cold applications. If it
occurs from internal use, administer large doses of bicarbonate of
soda in water. Administer artificial respiration if the patient is
insensible.


=For Nux Vomica.=--Tobacco, chewing or smoking, and animal charcoal,
dissolved in water. Follow with emetics. Use artificial respiration
when necessary.


=For Opium.=--Administer an emetic, such as mustard or ipecac. Apply
water to the head, face, and spine. Give strong coffee, but do not give
alcoholic stimulants. Keep the patient aroused by walking, whipping, or
other means. Use artificial respiration if necessary.


=For Arsenic.=--Give emetics immediately, including draughts of hot,
greasy water or salt and water. Administer in large doses magnesia or
lime scraped from the walls or ceilings. Give castor oil, sweet oil, or
equal parts of sweet oil and lime water, or raw eggs. Use stimulants
well diluted.


=For Corrosive Sublimate.=--Administer an emetic and large doses of
white of eggs, milk, mucilage, barley water, or flour and water. Force
the patient to swallow large quantities. Use the stomach pump.


=For Belladonna.=--Give emetics and stimulants. Apply warmth to
extremities and mustard plasters to the feet. Use artificial
respiration if necessary.


=For Poisonous Mushrooms.=--Give emetics, castor oil, stimulants, and
apply heat.


=Pulse.=--The average rate of the pulse in adults is 76 beats every
minute; but it varies according to age. At birth it is from 130 to 140;
1st year, 115 to 130; 2d year, 100 to 115; 3d year, 95 to 105; between
7 and 14, 80 to 90; between 14 and 21, 75 to 80; between 21 and 60,
70 to 75; in old age, from 75 to 80. The female pulse is from 10 to
15 beats quicker than that of the male of the same age. To count the
pulse, place the finger over the artery at the wrist; count the beats
for 15 seconds, multiply this by four, and the result is the number of
beats a minute. Do not use the thumb, as there is a sort of pulse in
it which interferes with counting.


=Rheumatism.=--So far as is known, there is no certain cure for
rheumatism, notwithstanding the many nostrums that are advertised
as sure cures. Rheumatism may be helped by avoiding meat and other
nitrogenous foods, confining the diet to vegetables and similar foods,
and drinking water freely. Rheumatism, however, is too serious to be
treated by other than a physician.


Scalds and Burns

Place the patient in a comfortable and safe place and remove the
clothing rapidly with a knife or scissors. If it sticks, cut away as
much as is necessary, but don't pull it off. Clothing may sometimes be
removed by sprinkling with water or oil. Do not expose the surface of
the burn or scald to the air. Cover as quickly as possible with flour
or vaseline and wrap a cloth about it wet with a solution of water and
common baking soda.

If the clothing is afire, force the person to lie down immediately,
wrap him in a blanket or other piece of cloth, preferably of woolen. Do
not allow him to run around or expose himself to a draught. Fire may be
extinguished by slapping the burning parts with a cloth, or throwing
water upon the person, but the wrapping process is better, because it
immediately smothers the fire, and water is not always available.

Slight scalds or burns may be relieved by the application of a
solution made of a pint of water with one teaspoonful of baking soda
or saleratus. Apply with a piece of lint, and then cover the burn or
scald with absorbent cotton, held in place by a bandage. If the burn or
scald is severe, apply sweet oil, olive oil, vaseline, or the white of
an egg. If these are not handy, cover the spot with starch or use damp
earth.

Burns caused by lye, and other alkaline chemicals, should be covered
with water, then with vinegar, and then treated as those by fire.

Burns caused by acids and vitrol should be soaked with water and
thoroughly washed with soda (saleratus) or lime water. Chalk or tooth
powder may be used when saleratus is not available.

Carbolic acid burns may be treated with strong alcohol.

Burns of the mouth or throat coming from the drinking of hot fluids,
may be treated by taking oil or the white of an egg into the mouth and
allowing it to run into the throat if the throat is affected. Vinegar
should be used for burns in the mouth coming from caustic potash and
ammonia. If the burn is serious, summon the doctor.

Burns caused by gunpowder should be treated the same as are ordinary
burns.


Shock or Collapse

Shock or collapse frequently occurs after serious accidents. It can
be foretold generally, because the skin is cool and clammy, and it is
usually accompanied with vomiting or rapid pulse, irregular breathing,
or sighing, and the eyelids may be heavy, the pupils dilated, and the
mind is not active. Insensibility frequently accompanies a shock. Send
for a surgeon or doctor immediately. Place the patient in a warm bed,
if possible, cover him with blankets, and allow his head to lie low.
Remove all clothing, cutting it to save time. Wrap bandages around
wounds or broken bones.

Hot cloths, or hot water bags, or a hot brick wrapped in cloth should
be applied to the region of the heart, the pit of the stomach, and the
feet. If wet cloths are used, wring them out frequently in hot water
and re-apply them. It is not necessary to use heat sufficient to burn
the skin. Under no circumstances apply heat to the head.

If possible, force the patient to drink hot water, hot tea, hot coffee,
or hot milk. Malted milk is excellent, but it should be hot. Whisky and
other alcoholic liquor should not be given, except by the advice of a
doctor. Half a teaspoonful of aromatic spirits of ammonia in water may
be given every 15 minutes for four doses, but not more. Stimulants
should not be given after the patient begins to recover.

Vomiting may be stopped or relieved by administering a little brandy
mixed with cracked ice.

If the skull is injured or there is concussion of the brain, with
or without the appearance of apoplexy or severe breathing, do not
administer a stimulant.


=Sleeplessness.=--Insomnia rapidly lowers the vital forces. It is
due to several causes, including mental worry, indigestion, physical
overexercise, and functional or organic diseases. Insomnia may be
considered a natural warning of coming ailment. The cause should be
located, and a good physician should be consulted. Sleep is encouraged
by exercise in the open air and by taking hot drinks just before
retiring. Hot malted milk is excellent; but solid food should not be
taken just before retiring. Mild gymnastic exercise may be taken before
an open window, but drugs should never be administered without the
advice of a physician.


=Snake Bite.=--Do not waste valuable time to kill the snake. If the
bite is venomous, rip open the clothing so that the wound will be
exposed. Tie a handkerchief or rope around the arm or leg, above the
bite. It should be drawn so tight that the circulation will be stopped
or retarded. The use of a stick or pencil will assist in giving
pressure. With a knife, open the holes made by the snake's fangs and
cut around the wound liberally, being careful not to sever an artery.
Let the blood run freely. Poison is sometimes removed by sucking a
wound, but one should not do this if his lips are chapped or bleeding.
The wound should be washed with soda solution and large doses of whisky
or brandy should be administered. Call a surgeon immediately.


=Sore Throat.=--Sore throat may be merely local or be a forerunner of
diphtheria. Better consult a physician.


=Sprains.=--Most sprains are serious, and a doctor should be called
at once, but before he arrives the following simple treatment may be
applied. Sprains twist and tear the ligaments and may rupture the
small blood vessels. The flow of blood may be checked by application
of cold or heat or by pressure. If the ankle or foot is sprained, wrap
a folded towel tightly around the part sprained and then apply moist
heat and elevate the leg. Immerse the foot in water as hot as can be
borne and keep on adding hot water for about 20 minutes, so that the
temperature may not be lowered; then apply a bandage, but continue the
bathing treatment. Cold applications may be used instead of hot water,
and should be applied by dipping cloths in ice water frequently, and
wrapping them about the parts injured.


=Stings of Poisonous Insects= or of scorpions, centipedes, etc., should
be treated with hartshorn, ammonia, after which cold water or cracked
ice should be applied. Do not fail to call a surgeon or doctor. If the
sting remains in the wound, remove it either by pressure on the skin or
with a knife. The stings of common insects, such as mosquitoes, ants,
etc., should be treated with a weak solution of ammonia, salt water, or
a cloth wet with water in which a teaspoonful of baking soda to a pint
of water is dissolved, may be bound on it.


=Suffocation.=--Always summon a physician. Place the patient in the
air, remove all tight clothing about the neck and chest, and apply
artificial respiration. Apply hot water in bottles to the body. Put
mustard plasters above the heart, on the soles of his feet, and on
his wrists. When the patient shows signs of recovering, give mild
stimulants. If the patient is in a close room, open the windows and all
of the doors. In rescue work do not open windows, but smash out all of
the glass. In entering a room full of smoke, cover the mouth with a
handkerchief wet with water or vinegar and water. Crawl on the floor,
as the smoke is less dense near the floor. The rescuer should attach a
rope to himself, so he can be pulled from his dangerous position.
