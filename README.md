###Artist Statement_**

#### This poem generator is based off of a poem that I wrote while walking
#### around the block in my Baton Rouge neighborhood. There was a large storm on the
#### horizon, and it made me think of the fragility of the old structures that I was
#### walking by. It made the think about the inevitability of change in culture and how powerful
#### a change must be in order to alter it's structure. In our ever more interconnected
#### world we also see languages leaving different cultures at an escalating rate. This poem  
#### focuses on utilizing online language translators to alter the structure of my poem so that
#### it walks a fine line in between maintaining its structure and losing it all together.
